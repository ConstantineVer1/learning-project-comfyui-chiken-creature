questions:
1. if sam does not search for an onbject, if my prompt would be "center", and there is group of people on an image, what would be sam reponse?
2. So, in essence, sam is full sacle model, but oriented  to determine prewcise object boundaries? right?
3. what node has output "segm_detector"?
4. in the most sam detectors there is text field, which i believe is for prompt. But, there is no two text fields, just one. how it is possible to provide positive and negative hints as you suggested?
5. if there is no clear guidance for sam, how many mask will he disscover in the complex image???
